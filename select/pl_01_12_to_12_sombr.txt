I don't want anyone else
From the hours of 12 to 12
I am not the least compelled
By anyone but yourself
Look at me, it makes me melt
I know you wanna see me in hell,
my love
I'm dealing with the cards
I've dealt
While you're dancing
with somebody else
Was it always in your plan
to leave eventually?
Because to me,
there's no one else that
could make sense to me
The last and final puzzle piece
In a room full of people,
I look for you
Would you avoid me or would
you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through?
(Through)
Or do our hearts still beat
in two?
I've never felt anything
Like the love from my final days
Why'd you wait
To show me you could do it
this way?
Woah, I never look at you,
look at you the same
We met in a Paris cafe
I said,
"Can I sit with you?
Comment ça se fait?"
My mistake
If I'd known that it
would happen this way
I never looked at you,
looked in the first place
Was it always in your plan
to leave eventually?
Because to me,
there's no one else that
could make sense to me
The last and final puzzle piece
In a room full of people,
I look for you
Would you avoid me or would
you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through?
(Through)
Or do our hearts still beat
in two?
Baby, I'm delusional
And the way you act is usual
Maybe in another world
I won't feel so unlovable
(Unlovable)
Oh
(Unlovable)
In a room full of people,
I look for you
Would you avoid me or would
you look for me too?
Tell me, is our story through?
(Through)
Or do our hearts still beat
in two?
In a room full of people,
I look for you
Would you avoid me or would
you see me through?
Tell me, is our story through?
(Through)
Or do our hearts still beat
in two?
